# timetable-registry

JSON timetable files for Amrita Bengaluru. These are currently crowdsourced, we're working on a better way to get these 'from the source'. In the meantime, feel free to contribute! It's greatly appreciated.

This was originally created for the ASEB Timetable app. If you find yourself using it for something else, please let us know! Drop us an email at [contact@amrita.town](mailto:contact@amrita.town). A hosted version is available at https://timetable-registry.amrita.town/index.json
